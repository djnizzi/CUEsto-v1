**CUEsto** is a powerful desktop application designed to make CUE sheet editing effortless. Built with modern web technologies, it offers a sleek interface with both light and dark modes, real-time duration calculations, and intuitive metadata management.

## Features

- 🎨 **Modern UI**: A focused interface with support for **Light and Dark modes**, built with custom branded modals.
- ⚡ **Fast & Responsive**: Built on Vite and React for instant feedback.
- ✂️ **Audio Splitting**: Slice large audio files into individual tracks directly from the CUE sheet using bundled FFmpeg.
- 🕵️ **CUE Viewer**: Inspect your raw CUE sheet with syntax highlighting in a dedicated window.
- ⏱️ **Metadata Persistence**: Support for custom `REM` lines, including `TOTAL DURATION`, `GNUCDID`, `DISCOGS`, and `MUSICBRAINZ_DISCID`.
- 🏷️ **Enhanced Metadata**: Auto-captures and saves `BARCODE`, `LABEL`, and `CATALOG` number from MusicBrainz.
- 🎵 **Audio Integration**: Link audio files to your CUE sheet. Automatically extract duration and metadata (performer, title, year, genre) from audio files with multi-artist support.
- 📥 **Import Tools**: Support for importing tracklists from **GnuDB**, **1001tracklists**, **Discogs**, **MusicBrainz**, and **Audacity**.
- 🖥️ **Cross-Platform**: Runs on Windows, Mac, and Linux (via Electron).
